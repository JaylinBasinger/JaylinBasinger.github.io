To craft his map I made a scread sheet to gather the cordinates of importtant places of this indivuals, their schoool, and then all the businesses, churches, schools, libraries and more and pin pointed them throughout the map. I used Blender again in this map because the region is deep in Eastern Kentucky and thier mountains are a big representation of what life is like there, and Blender allowed me to bring those mountains to life. I used Tree coverage layers and impervious surface layers to create the basemap in QGIS and then designed they map in Photoshop and Illustrator. </div>
