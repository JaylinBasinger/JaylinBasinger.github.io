I chose to map my hometown because I had been wanting to map the area, but early on in my mapping career there was little vector data, specifcally for roads and water bodies, on the region due to its remoteness.But thanks to advancemnet in data from the Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access I was able to make my wish a reality. </div>
