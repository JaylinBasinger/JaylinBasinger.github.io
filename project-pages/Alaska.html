It was supposed to be a representation of everything we had learned thoughout the semester and worked into a final work. I was playing a lot with themes and visulizing a theme with the layout of the map. This map not a colorful pne, and the only color that is used are shades of red, to symbolize the bloodshed and human loss associated with mining and specifically the mining accidents that had been documented from 1940 until this point in 2023.</div>
          <div class="body-text"> I also did alot of my own qualitative research for a map, in which I gathered as many mining accidnets that had been doucmented and published online and placed thier cordinated into the map. I wanted to learn why these accidents happened and to represent that as best as possible in a a few sentences. I found that most of these accidents had been a result of negligence on part of mine operators and owners and miners pay for such negligence with thier lives.
