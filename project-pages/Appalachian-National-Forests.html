I had made many maps using the standard page layout in Qgis at that point, but this was the first one that I took out of a mapping software and in to Adobe Creative Suite. The editing thorugh Illustrator and Photoshop are what brought this map to life and gave it character.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The main goal of this map was to understand typography and to create a variety of labels that both are independant and readable, but also flow and work together with the rest of the elements on the map and I think this was a good first attempt at it and bouncing off point for more complex typographic setups.</div>
