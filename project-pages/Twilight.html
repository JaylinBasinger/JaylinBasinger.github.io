          <div class="body-text">This project was for my Advanced Cartography class in which we were tasked with creating a narrative map that told a visual story and led the viewing thoughout the page and told a story. I had chosen to do a movie map after viewing maps by Andrew DeGraff and his hand drawn movie maps.I felt to make the best movie map it should be a movie I was familar with, so I did my lifelong favorite movie series Twilight.  </div>
          <div class="body-text">This map was a very different process than any map I had made before. I made this map or image almost entirely in Procreate, a drawing software avaible for Mac products. I first took screenshots of the real life toens and roads and stiched themtogether in a way that would allow me to get a semi accurate road and river layout from Forks to La Push. This took many drafts but eventually I got a someone accurate, or least reconizable depiction of the roads. I took a mini map that was made for the Illistrated Guide of the Twilight series and used that to pin point where the fictional places in the town would be located. I drew an accompanied structure or scene for each point on the map and then drew lines to indicated where each character went. I think this is a intresting porject I took on, and I learned a lot along the way, specifically in the way colors are depicted on different screens and programs. For this map the colros looked perfect while I was drawing them on my iPad, but when exported to Illistrator for the text elements the colors drastically changed.    </div>
